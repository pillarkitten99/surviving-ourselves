            <h3>What is needed to address the problem?</h3>
            <!-- at least 2 artifacts -->
                <p>What is your vision of a social solution to the American health care crisis?   Everyone has at least basic care access without ridiculous copays. Working toward universal health care with a private option for people who feel that is imporant.</p>
                <p>What is the goal society you are imagining?    Healthier society, maybe people don't have to leave the country for health reasons (source here? idk)</p>
                <p>Is this a long-term or short term solution?   This is a multi part solution with immediate effects and longer term goals and effects. We could immediately work on reducing admin costs (cite ideas from the article). This money could then be used to give everyone who is uninsured some health insurance. It could also be used to reduce deductibles for people who are covered but still cannot afford to use their insurance. This portion of the solution would not change the dynamics of the system we already have, since we already have regular insurance through employment or the marketplace in addition to Medicaid and Medicare for those who qualify. Having reduced admin costs could give enough money to give all of the uninsured people Medicaid insurance (cite the costs per person here for an average person I guess). Once this part of the plan is working, we can think about longer term changes. One option would be to incenivize positive health outcomes instead of the number of procedures done. For example, primary care physicians in the United Kingdom receive a bonus for having positive health outcomes in their clinics. This would be more difficult to implement in the United States since we do not have a centralized payment structure for physicians, but it could be done through government programs just like the government supplements farmers who grow certain crops, they could supplement the income of doctors who help their patients heal too. The third part of this plan is to adjust our education system. Schools are not required to teach about the health care system, and especially not about health care systems of other nations. If we began teaching children about the world, about how other societies do things like ensure the health of their citizens, we could have real change in the future. This would take many years, probably more than a generation, to have an effect of policy decisions, but having an educated population will benefit America. If Americans understood that there are different options out there that don't involve risking bankruptcy, avoiding ambulances, having to call multiple customer service numbers to find out if your insurance will allow you a life saving treatment, only being able to visit one specialist who cannot even fix the condition but not being able to afford to see anyone else, then our health care system could be very different. </p>
                <p>How does the solution solve the problem?</p>
                <p>Why have you selected this solution (Or, why is it the best solution?)    This multi part solution addresses many aspects of the health care problem and provides ways to fix them in a gradual way that would not immediately disrupt the whole country (because Americans would not vote for a sudden upheaval of the whole system at one time). It first looks at things we can change immediately (or over the next few years) by reducing administrative costs. Next, it describes how we can use the savings from the first point to benefit Americans who are in the worst position regarding having access to health care and how to encourage positive health outcomes when patients visit the doctor. Finally, it talks about the future, a more educated nation that is better able to critically think about social issues such as health care from a more global perspective. This will allow us to have the best chances at being a health nation in the future.</p>
