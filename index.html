        <p>The United States has a health care system that is quite different than that of other wealthy countries. The
            American health care system has access to the modern technology needed to produce high quality health
            outcomes for its residents. It also is home to many world-renowned research hospitals developing new and
            improved medical treatments with some of the highest paid doctors in the world. The country also spends the
            most on health care per-capita in the entire world. What truly sets it apart, though, is the fact that over
            10 percent of Americans cannot even access health insurance, and those that do are not guaranteed affordable
            care.</p>
        <p>What?</p>
        <p>Yep. Millions of normal Americans do not have access to their own health care system despite the enormous
            costs associated with maintaining it. For most nonelderly people in the United States, health insurance is
            tied to employment. This means that, in order to qualify for health insurance, the typical American must be
            employed at a company that provides insurance (for a price, of course). Unemployed, underemployed, and
            non-working Americans have the option to purchase health insurance at a price determined by market rates.
            For those with little-to-no income, public health insurance through Medicaid is an option, but the
            eligibility requirements vary greatly by state and exclude millions of Americans who cannot afford health
            insurance from the marketplace. Explore this graphic from the Kaiser Family Foundation Kaiser Family
            Foundation to compare the number of uninsured people in each of the states. As you can see, even the best
            states have a significant portion of their population living without health insurance</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, even the ~90% of Americans who do have health insurance cannot always afford treatment. As you
            see in the next graphic from the Kaiser Family Foundation, over 46% of insured Americans are worried about
            paying their medical bills if they were to have an accident. In addition to that, 53% of privately insured
            Americans and 73% of publicly insured Americans are unable to pay their medical bills. Those are extremely
            significant numbers.</p>
        <p>So, what can be done?</p>
        <p>The American health care crisis is an enormous task that would require multiple steps and a perfect societal
            and governmental set-up to get started anytime soon. The following proposes one hypothetical solution, a
            multi-phase approach that begins with increasing insurance coverage and ends with widespread education and
            the potential for systemic change to benefit Americans for generations to come. First, let's look at the
            data. How much is the United States really paying for healthcare, and who is paying it? This graphic from
            McKinsey & Company divides up health care spending in the United States by amount and stakeholder. It also
            shows us that 25% of the total spending is spent on administrative costs.</p>
        <img src="admin_spending.svgz" alt="US health care spending by type and stakeholder">
        <p>The first step of this solution is to reduce those administrative costs and use the extra money to provide
            public health insurance to the uninsured. As you can see in the next image, the largest administrative cost
            for the United States are Industry Agnostic Corporate Functions. These are non-clinical functions that help
            the system run, such as human resources and accreditation. The next most costly category is the Financial
            Transactions Ecosystem, the part of the system that involves claims, billing, and the movement of payments.
            For anyone who has been involved in the American health care system, it is clear that these aspects have
            room for improvement.</p>
        <img src="spending_focus_areas.svgz" alt="Administrative spending by functional focus area">
        <p>Now, let's do some quick math.</p>
        <p>According to Medicaid.gov,
            https://www.medicaid.gov/state-overviews/scorecard/how-much-states-spend-per-medicaid-enrollee/index.html
            the median total cost of healthcare for someone on Medicaid is $8,436. With an annual administrative budget
            of 950 billion dollars, even a reduction of 10% would be enough to save 9.5 billion dollars per year, enough
            to pay the median cost of Medicaid for about 11 million people. Bringing that up to 30% would be enough to
            provide every single uninsured American with insurance. Reducing costs by this much would be a major feat,
            but it would be possible through the use of technology. Many of the administrative costs are incurred due to
            repetitive tasks that could be automated. One example of this is inputting insurance information into each
            provider's system by hand. An easy alternative to this would be scanners that read and input the data from
            the insurance cards into a digital form, freeing up administrative employees to work on things that machines
            cannot do.</p>
        <p>Another way to reduce administrative costs is to make insurance information and coverage more easily
            accessible for patients and providers. In the current system, with public or private insurance, patients
            sometimes must wait months to find out if their insurance will cover a drug, just to be told they do not
            meet the eligibility criteria. By putting this information in an accessible place online, patients and
            providers could save time by doing a simple online search instead of spending hours writing emails, sending
            physical letters, and waiting on hold. Although it would be difficult, these changes could be made without
            even requiring large-scale systemic change. Going for smaller changes rather than drastic ones would be the
            best option because of the heated political climate regarding all social issues in the United States.
            Businesses in every sector are turning to technology to streamline their services. By following this trend,
            the United States could save billions of dollars each year on administrative costs and be able to provide
            insurance to all Americans. This would not solve all of our problems, since many insured Americans still
            cannot afford their medical bills, but it would be a step in the right direction. Once all Americans have
            access to healthcare, discussions could begin about how to make it more affordable for the average American.
